                        Omnes [.]anc [or sane?] Philosophi, et Astronomi consentiunt 
                        diuersas qualitates Eleme[n]toru[m], qua[e] in Planetis sunt, 
                        causam fuisse, cur hunc situm, et ordinem haberent, 
                        quem nu[n]c habent; ut stella Iouis, quae temperata 
                        est, poneretur inter Saturnu[m] frigidiorem, et Marte[m]
                        calidiore[m], qu&agrave;m par est: Mars calidus, et situs
                        inter Iouem, et Venerem, iuxta Platonicos:
                        vt quod uocere possit nimi&ugrave;m in vna stella,
                        tardetur contraria qualitate in altera.
                        
                        Antigui Astrologi, cu[m] scirent Solem in Cancro <!--JG: Partly taken from 'Wilhelm von Conches, De philosophia mundi?-->

                        planetaru[m] esset in co[e]le[m] signo cu[m] sole,
                        [reput]entesq[ue] Saturnu[m], statuerunt eius
                        frigiditatem causam fuisse: quod postea
                        semper notatu[m] est, semel prim&ograve; obseruatu[m].

                A proper mixture with surrounding gasses produces only lively things, only stupid things. <!--JG: Unsure about this, doesn't really make sense to me-->
                
                All philosophers and astronomers agreed that diverse qualities of the elements, which are in the planets, was the cause why they had this position and order, which they have now; so that the star of Jupiter, which was mild, was placed between Saturn, a cold planet, and Mars, a hot one. Likewise:
                Mars, hot, and situated between Jupiter and Venus, according to Platonics: <!--JG: iuxta Platonicos doesn't really make sense to me--> so that what is possible to call excessive in one star, is checked by a contrary quality in another.
                
                The ancient astrologers, although they knew that the sun scorched the earth in the south; and nevertheless they saw that this hardly happened in the other year; understanding that this was not because of the sun, they sought which star of the planets was in the sky with the sun's sign, 
                and pondering Saturn, they decided that this was the cause of its cold: what afterwards always was noted, once it was observed at first.
