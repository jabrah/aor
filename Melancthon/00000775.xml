                A proper mixture with surrounding gasses produces only lively things, only stupid things. <!--JG: Unsure about this, doesn't really make sense to me-->
                <!-- The temperature of the surrounding air makes things at one moment more lively, at another more languid.--> <!-- CG: Here's my attempt. -->                
                
                All philosophers and astronomers agreed that diverse qualities of the elements, which are in the planets, was the cause why they had this position and order, which they have now; so that the star of Jupiter, which was mild, was placed between Saturn, a cold planet, and Mars, a hot one. Likewise:
                Mars, hot, and situated between Jupiter and Venus, according to Platonics: <!--JG: iuxta Platonicos doesn't really make sense to me--> so that what is possible to call excessive in one star, is checked by a contrary quality in another.
                
                <!-- Almost all philosophers and astronomers agreed that the diverse qualities of the elements found in the planets was the reason why they had the position and order which they have now; 
                thus, the star of Jupiter, which is mild, was placed between Saturn, a colder planet, and Mars, a hotter one. Likewise, accordin gto the Platonists,
                Mars, hot and dry, is situated between Jupiter and Venus. Thus, what could be called excessive in one star is checked by a contrary quality in another. -->

                The ancient astrologers, although they knew that the sun scorched the earth in the south; and nevertheless they saw that this hardly happened in the other year; understanding that this was not because of the sun, they sought which star of the planets was in the sky with the sun's sign, 
                and pondering Saturn, they decided that this was the cause of its cold: what afterwards always was noted, once it was observed at first.
                
                <!-- The ancient astrologers, when they knew that the sun scorched the earth in the summer, but nevertheless saw that this did not happen in another year,

                    they decided that this was the cause of the cold. What is observed afterwards, was first noticed at one time. --> <!-- CG: The last bit seems like an aphorism. -->
