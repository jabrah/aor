                        Sal minerale p[ri]m&ograve; nobis proponitur: vegetabile ex leone viridi oritur et Animale ex rubro leone elicitur:
                        vna tame[n] materia est et corpus vnu[m]: a candore, salis obtineus nome[n], et a corrosiva sua natura. I. d.       <!-- DO: Think it might be 'obtinens', going by the translation -->

            <translation>Salt is our first mineral displayed: the vegetative is born from the green lion and the animal is pulled forth from the red lion: one is still a material and one a body:
            the name of salt is obtained by beauty, and its nature by corrosiveness.</translation> <!--KS: This makes no sense, not sure.-->

        <!-- DO: Possibly something like: 'Salt is known as our first mineral: animating, it is born from the young lion and, alive, is drawn from the red lion; still one is a material and one is a body, taking the name of salt from its whiteness and from its corrosive nature.' Still odd though... Particularly unsure how to translate 'vegetabile' and 'animale' -->
