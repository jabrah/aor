                        The notablest men, that first commended the often and aduised reading of Liuie unto mee, were theise fiue, Doctor Henrie Haruey, 
                        M. Roger Ascham, Sir Thomas Smyth, Sir Walter Mildmay, Sir Philip Sidney: all learned, expert, and verie iudicious in the greatest 
                        matters of priuate, or publique qualitie. Once I heard M. Secretarie Wilson, and Doctor Binge preferr the Romane historie before the 
                        Greek, or other: and Liuie before anie other Romane historie. But of all other Sir Philip Sidney, Colonel Smyth, and Monsieur Bodin 
                        wunne mie hart to Liuie. Sir Philip Sidney esteemes no general Historie, like Justines abridgment of Trogus: nor anie special Roman 
                        historie like Liuie: nor anie particular historie, Roman, or other, like the singular life, and actions of Cesar: whome he values 
                        aboue all other, and reputes the greatest actour, that euer the world did afforde. And therefore makes exceeding account Sallust, 
                        Velleius, Suetonius in Latin; Plutarch, Dion, Julian in Greek: who as effectually, as briefly display him in his liuelie colours. 
                        But of none makes so high reckoning, as of Cesars owne Commentaries, peerles and inualuable works. Where his frends, and enimies 
                        beholde a most worthie man; modest in profession; pithie in discourse; discreet in iudgment; sound in resolution; quiet in expedition; 
                        constant in industrie; most uigorous in most daunger; surmounting the wisest in pollicie, the brauest in valour, the terriblest in 
                        execution, the cunningest in huge artificial works; allwaies inuincible, often incomparable, sumtime admirable in the accomplishment 
                        of the weightiest affaires, dowtiest exploits, and finest designes, that could be plotted bie himself in the profunditie of his 
                        surprising conceit. The onlie Mirrour of most excellent valour, and more excellent witt: to this day unmatchable, in so manie 
                        reuolutions of high, and deepe spirits; aspiring to the greatest things upon Earth; and leauing no possibilitie unextended. Yet amongst 
                        so manie valorous minds, and euen amonst so manie puissant Cesars, still but one Cesar. He, that brauely gaue it owt for his resolute 
                        word, Aut Caesar, aut nihil: howsoeuer exceedingly beholden to Machiauel, was indeed nihil in comparison of Cesar.
