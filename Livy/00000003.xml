             <translation>Yet no story in Livy of an outstanding man is more remarkable and noble than that of Camillus Furius, who is both an extraordinary man and a singular 
                 leader of his age. Whether it is his military expertise, his mental and physical strength, his outstanding diligence and excellence in executing [his task], 
                 or the very high esteem everybody has for him, it seems his good fortune in everything should be considered his most desired quality. 
                 Before Camillus Furius there were few outstanding Romans. Yet what a tremendous crop of the most courageous men and leaders most illustrious in the whole world has 
                 emerged from this wonderful Leader, as if from a unique seedbed of that vigorous, superbly powerful Roman excellence! What David was among the Jews, 
                 Cyrus among the Persians, Hector among the Trojans, Achilles among the Greeks, Epaminondas among the Thebans, Alexander among the Macedonians: 
                 incomparable and invincible Leaders – that is Camillus among the Romans, the most powerful commander of his time, and a remarkable example of so many 
                 vigorous and strong Romans, as after him Livy has made superbly and thoroughly known. That this Republic flourished to such a great degree and at last 
                 governed as a ruler of the world, was possible, I would think, not because of the political institution of the Republic, which was certainly not the 
                 best one for ruling, or governing, but because of several exceptional, most brilliant men, especially senators and officers; fully practised, some in law, 
                 others in arms, and burning with the permanent desire to surpass the most honourable deeds at home and abroad; whatever seemed to serve Roman excellence and dignity, 
                 they attempted all of it with serious judgement and the strongest care. Fortune responded to Virtue: and how great a harvest came from these vigorous, tremendous deeds,
                 and what great fame, public as well as private! From which [follows] that that particular greatness of the flourishing Republic and of its extremely powerful rule was not
                 so much a product of the public form of government, as of the insight and virtue of its public men. Pay attention, therefore, to the exploits of remarkable men, 
                 their outstanding deeds, records, whatever impressive feat there can be found in the state or on the field. And one must note even more carefully the things
                 that are most convenient for prevailing in a monarchy, and apply them very scrupulously to one's own purpose. The remaining aristocratic and democratic actions 
                 should be valued according to the esteem they earned in a monarchy, without detriment to the authority of royal majesty, which must not be harmed or prejudiced in any way. 
                 For in a principate one ought to moderate popular sentiments, just like philosophical veins as well, and all fanciful desires, and to align the qualities of the 
                 subjects to the state of the Prince, no matter how very pre-eminent they may be, and not to force private matters of the people or of the aristocracy upon the 
                 acts or plans of Kings. In this respect most royal counsels, magistrates and ministers err. For they do not know to distinguish skillfully and solidly between 
                 particular political situations of republics, and their own policies. This caused a thousand errors in public councils and acts. In histories, words and deeds 
                 are praised of those considered the wisest, bravest and most righteous among their fellow people. But it makes a big difference what kind of politician is
                 speaking or doing something, and to what purpose, and in what sort of Republic, and in what particular instance. Each one acts in the interests of his own situation, 
                 whether public of private, and no-one binds his own hands. In the Roman Republic many things were most prudently said and done, which would be absurd, if they were expressed 
                 in a Kingdom and in this age. Without judgment one does not know anything. And being useful is suitable for whatever is praiseworthy.
