                    <marginalia_text>tam politicum, quam militare, curiose observandum: praesertim in maximis negotiis, atq[ue] bellis. Neq[ue] enim conducit effectuum notitia potentissimorum, 
                        sine cognitione causarum. Leguntur Historia[e], ut discatur quod est in actionibus humanis excellentissimum, pace, et bello; domi, et foris: discitur, ut agatur: 
                        agitur optim&egrave;, non effectuum cognitione, magnifice descripta; sed causarum scientia, intime intellecta. Und&egrave; aquilinis h&icric;c oculis opus: et tam Iudicio solidissimo, 
                        quam Ingenio solertissimo. Certe, sine acutissima Analyse, praesertim politica, et polemica, vane leguntur Historiae, atq[ue] frustra. Promptissimum autem, 
                        ac praegnatissimum Romanae Historiae prooemium, Eutropii Breviarium; tam nervosum, atq[ue] efficax, quam succinctum, et pressum. Quae in Livio desiderata; 
                        a Sallustio, et Caesare; a Paterculo, et Cornelio Tacito supplentur; ea ne desiderantur quidem: sed ex illis continuo supplenda excellentissimis Prudentiae, 
                        Fortitudinisq[ue] Thesauris. Adde Plutarchum: et ecce tam Graecorum, quam Romanorum preciosissima monumenta: Deus maxime, quam egregia et axiozela?
                        Nihil sagacius, aut profundius: etiam acria, et valida omnia. Alii etiam insignes, et praestantes Romani Historici: et in primis Polybius, Halicarnasseus, 
                        Dion, pauci alii de selectiore nota, prudentes, atq[ue] solidi scriptores: sed ista maxime necessaria; et publico, privatoque usui utilissima. 
                        Nec vero ullo modo praetermittendus Suetonius; propter arcana principum, et quaedam Rerumpublicaru[m] secreta, dignissimus cognitu; praesertim Aulicis, 
                        et pragmaticis. Homo liber est, ut Petrus Aretinus, et Machiavellus: nec quicq[uam] celat mysteriorum Palatinorum, et hypocriticorum. 
                        Utilis est etiam multis egregiis exemplis Valerius Maximus: utilissimus callidis, solidisq[ue] Stratagematis Frontinus: maxime, si illi 
                        Egnatius addatur eadem Methodo; huic Gandinus Italice: quorum sunt eximia plaeraq[ue], ac memorabilia supplementa. 
                        Ego Romanis omnibus Historicis necessario addendos censeo; a politicis Machiavellum; a Iurisconsultis etiam Sigonium: et utrisque interdum proderit
                        Bodinus de Rep[ublica] ut bellatoribus egregie Vegetius; cum eo, quem dixi, Frontino, et Polyaeno. Neque enim quicq[uam] supra, vel Latine, 
                        vel Graece, vel ulla Lingua hodierna: seu politice quid agendum, seu polemice. Interim Livius maturime perlegendus, et acerrime: cuius neminem 
                        adhuc novi aut nimis studiosum historicum; aut satis observantem politicum. Ex iis autem, quae exstant, Livii explicationibus, nullas malim, 
                        quam Velcurionis annotationes historicas, et politicas: Danaei aphorismos politicos: Machiavelli discursus politicos. Qui et multos illustrant reconditos locos; 
                        et rem ipsam agunt, prudentibus, seriisq[ue] observationib[us]. Nec dubitem tamen, ex ipsis politicorum principiorum fontibus, 
                        altiores adhuc haurire privatae industriae, publicaeq[ue] gubernationis regulas, quam vel ab istis sunt, vel ab aliis observatoribus animadversae. 
                        Quomodo Aurelius Victor refert in Theodosio, Eum Imperatorem aliquando severa praecepta habuisse de Livio. Ut autem serio in Romana historia proficiatur; 
                        in primis expedit, tam Eutropii, quam Aurelii Victoris Breviarium, semper habere promptissimum: et inde delectum facere magis exquisitum. Ut certo constabit, 
                        personas, res, actiones, omne genus negotia maxime excellere. Ea enim Euscopi tripertita provincia. Quarta vero; vel accurata imitatio, vel strenua aemulatio. 
                        Tandem curiose contuli Civitatem hominum, cum Civitate Dei: et mirifice placuit collatio, profuitque syncrisis, tam politica, quam theologica. 
                        Certe axiozelus parallelismus.

            <translation>
                For both the political and the military should always be carefully studied, especially when dealing with extremely difficult situations and wars. 
                For knowledge of the most powerful results is of no use without learning to know the causes. One reads history in order to learn what is most brilliant 
                in human actions in peace and war, at home and abroad. One learns in order to act; one acts best not through a study of the outcomes, however splendid in presentation, 
                but through an intimate understanding of the causes. Therefore at this point one needs an eagle eye, and both a highly solid judgement and an extremely skilled intellect. 
                Really, without a very sharp analysis, especially political and military, reading historical accounts is futile and pointless. Now the most manifest and dense introduction 
                to Roman History is Eutropius’ Breviarium, which is as lively and effective as it is concise and compressed. What is missing in Livy is made good by Sallust and Caesar, 
                by Velleius Paterculus and Tacitus. And these things are not just missing, but must be supplied continually from these absolutely outstanding storehouses of prudence and courage. 
                Include Plutarch, and there you have the most valuable monuments of both the Greeks and Romans -- great God, how eminent and enviable! There is nothing more acute or profound; 
                all are penetrating and vigorous as well. There are also other distinguished and outstanding Roman historians, in particular Polybius, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 
                Cassius Dio and a few others of a more exclusive class, judicious and solid authors, but these ones are indispensable above all, and extremely convenient for public and private use. 
                And also Suetonius should in no way be overlooked; he very much deserves to be studied, especially by courtiers and legal practitioners on account of the secrets of the emperors, 
                and several secrets of states. Man is free, as Pietro Aretino and Macchiavelli say, and nothing hides the secrets of those on the Palatine and the pretenders. 
                Also useful for his many superb examples is Valerius Maximus; extremely useful for his shrewd and powerful Stratagems is Frontinus; and especially so if one adds to him 
                Egnatius with the same approach, and to him Gandinus in Italian. Their complements are mostly excellent and memorable. 
                I believe that the following authors should be added of necessity to all Roman historians: from the politicians Macchiavelli, from the legal scholars also Sigonio, 
                and beneficial for both of these fields from time to time will be Bodin’s De Republica, just as Vegetius is superbly beneficial for warriors, and along with him, as I said, 
                Frontinus and Polyaenus. And there is nothing beyond these, either in Latin, Greek or any other modern language, on how one has to act either politically or militarily. 
                Meanwhile Livy has to be studied as fully and thoroughly as possible. Yet so far I do not know any historian who studies him very deeply or any politician who takes 
                sufficient notice of him. Of the existing commentaries to Livy, however, I like none better than Velcurio’s historical and political notes, Daneau’s political maxims and 
                Machiavelli’s political discourses. These both illuminate many obscure passages, and discuss the subject itself with intelligent and earnest remarks. 
                And yet I would not hesitate to derive from the sources of the foremost politicians themselves even higher rules about private assiduity and public government than 
                those noted by these or other observers. As Aurelius Victor reports about Theodosius, that this emperor from time to time had weighty teachings about Livy.
                But in order to make significant progress in Roman history, it is above all useful always to keep both Eutropius’ and Aurelius Victor’s Breviarium very close to hand, 
                and from there to make a more carefully considered choice, so that it will be certain for a fact that the activities are most superior in each class, with respect to persons, 
                subjects, and deeds. For that is the threefold province of Euscopus. In fact, there is a fourth: either exact imitation, or brisk emulation.
                Finally, I carefully compared the city of men with the City of God, and the comparison was wonderfully pleasing; and the contrast, both political and theological, was helpful. 
                It was certainly an enviable parallelism.
