            <translation>John of Damascus, who lived in the time of the emperors Theodosius and Valentian, had among himself a Persian disciple, whom 
            he educated diligently. That disciple forged a letter with the name of John of Damascus, whose hand he could imitate, with this indication: I,
            John of Damascus, show to the Persian king that, is he wishes, he should come. Since it is already possible to capture emperor Valentian, 
            by means of another after another occasion. <!--JG: Unsure about this sentence--> This letter was scattered in the palace of the Persian king, which, having 
            been presented to himself, soon he sent to the emperor. The emperor summoned John of Damascus to him, pointed out the letter to him, and asked
            why he had written it. John of Damascus, inspecting it diligently, said: "Lord emperor, I recognise my hand, nor can I deny this letter. But 
            by the holy law, I never thought neither wrote such a thing." To which the emperor [replied]: "You cannot deny [this]: it is your hand." Thus
            the man was defeated and his right hand was cut off. The crafty disciple repaid such thanks to his teacher.</translation>
