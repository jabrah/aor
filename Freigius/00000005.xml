                        <!-- JE: there's a funny 'pi' with a squiggle symbol here after 'Forma' - is this Greek? 
                        Also, I've made an attempt to represent the shape of the schema, perhaps vainly-->
                        <!-- CG: That definitely looks like a π, although it would never have a diacritic over it like that. 
                        I looked around at some ligatures, and there's a possibility that it might be something like 'πως' but
                        I don't think that would make much sense. It could also very well be an ornamental squiggly. What do Jaap and
                        Pr. Jardine think? -->
                        <!-- JE: could be something like 'πως'. I've put it in for the moment, but I think we could do with a once-over from a real Greek specialist? -->
                        <!--JG: I agree, we need the advice from a Greek specialist-->

                1.2. Lorenzo Valla praises a wonderful style in the preface of the third book of the 'Elegancies'.
                3. Pierre Gregoire, Doctor of Canon and Civil Law, examines and discusses the method in chapter two of 'De iuris 
                arte, methodo, et praeceptis', where, generally speaking, he proceeds in this way. Certainly, we can defend in some
                way the order in the body of the 'Digest'. But, actually, not by this approach, because the 'Arte' is digested: many 
                things can, and should, be more appropriately positioned than where they are placed. But they are arranged according to 
                the order as it is taught by those who stitch together the law. 
                <!-- CG: I'm wondering if the phrase "Ubi generatim isto modo" is a way of introducing the following sentences
                as a sort of progression for the method found in the Gregoire's text. Something like "There, it is generally
                like this: 1) Certe ordinem ... 2) verum non ea ratione ... 3) etiam habita ratione ..." What do you think? -->
                <!-- JE: I'm not conviced, I'm afraid, because point 2 seems to be referring to Gregoire's book in Harvey's voice. I wonder if 'isto modo' refers back 
                    to the diagram, i.e. Gregoire examines the form of the Digest according to its internal structure, but (Harvey says) his approach is wrong, because 
                    the order he is discussing is not in fact the order of the Digest, but something stitched together. Although that doesn't exactly gel with the comments on 
                    00000007. I can't find a copy of Gregoire's book online unfortunately. 
                    I think this point could probably benefit from the eyes of a specialist in early modern law! -->
                Add here the judgement of Dr Thomas Smith in the 'Legal Preface'. 
                <!-- JE: I can't find this, perhaps a reference to 'De Republica Anglorum'? -->
                <!-- CG: I also looked around at Thomas Smith, and it looks like that is probably the book Harvey's talking about.
                I wonder if he is simply referring to one of the sections on law from the De Republica Anglorum?-->
                <!-- JE: I've tagged the 'De republica Anglorum' - there's a lot of legal stuff in it - but it doesn't seem a totally convincing match. -->
                Also Francois Douaren, book one of 'Disputationum anniversariarum libri duo', chapter 55, where he agrees with the 
                order and method of the 'Digest', refuting the innovators, who busy themselves with amending this method.
