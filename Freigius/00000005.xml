                        <!-- JE: there's a funny 'pi' with a squiggle symbol here after 'Forma' - is this Greek? 
                        Also, I've made an attempt to represent the shape of the schema, perhaps vainly-->
                        <!-- CG: That definitely looks like a π, although it would never have a diacritic over it like that. 
                        I looked around at some ligatures, and there's a possibility that it might be something like 'πως' but
                        I don't think that would make much sense. It could also very well be an ornamental squiggly. What do Jaap and
                        Pr. Jardine think? -->

                                                                                            {   that which is to be deliberated.

                1.2. Lorenzo Valla praises a wonderful style in the preface of the third book of the 'Elegancies'.
                3. Pierre Gregoire, Doctor of Canon and Civil Law, examines and discusses the method in chapter two of 'De iuris 
                arte, methodo, et praeceptis', where it is, in general, in this way. Certainly, we can defend in some way the order
                    <!-- CG: I'm wondering if the phrase "Ubi generatim isto modo" is a way of introducing the following sentences
                    as a sort of progression for the method found in the Gregoire's text. Something like "There, it is generally
                    like this: 1) Certe ordinem ... 2) verum non ea ratione ... 3) etiam habita ratione ..." What do you think? -->
                in the body of the 'Digest'. But, actually, not by this reasoning, because the 'Arte' is digested. Many things can, 
                and should, be more appropriately positioned than where they are placed, but they are arranged according to the 
                order as it is taught by the [?consareinatores?] of law. 
                Add here the judgement of Dr Thomas Smith in the 'Legal Preface'. 
                <!-- JE: I can't find this, perhaps a reference to 'De Republica Anglorum'? -->
                <!-- CG: I think the word might be 'consarcinatores' and I think it's a neologism from 'consarcino' which means
                to sew or to stitch together: http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dconsarcino -->
                <!-- CG: I also looked around at Thomas Smith, and it looks like that is probably the book Harvey's talking about.
                I wonder if he is simply referring to one of the sections on law from the De Republica Anglorum?-->
                Also Francois Douaren, book one of 'Disputationum anniversariarum libri duo', chapter 55, where he agrees with the 
                order and method of the 'Digest', refuting the innovators, who busy themselves with amending this method.
                <!-- JE: if someone with a knowledge of early modern law could check this translation I'd be grateful -->
                <!-- CG: Sorry I'm not going to be much help! -->
