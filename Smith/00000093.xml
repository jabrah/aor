                        Istius Thoma[e] Smithi reformata[e] Orthographia[e] Ecc&egrave; honorifica sa[e]p&egrave;
                        mentio in Baretti alueario Anglico, Latino, Gra[e]co, Francico. In literis A: H: S:
                        Smitho de Orthographia contra Cacographiam Secundus, in suo alphabeto Barettus.
                        Nec ver&ograve; contemnendus de Orthographia Chesterus, ille etiam polyglottus.
                        Adhuc tamen pla[e]riq[ue] veterani cum Consuetudine delirant: et illum vetulum abusum
                        etiamnum obseruant, qui etsi non est ex vsu, in vsu tamen est.

                See the often honorific mention of this Thomas Smith's reformed spelling, made in Barettus's 'Apiary' of 
                English, Latin, Greek and French. In the letters A, H, and S.
                In his alphabet, Barettus follows Smith on spelling against ugly writing.
                In fact, Chester on spelling is not to be scorned; he is, after all, a polyglot. 
                At present, however, many of the old authors are used to deviating from the right path, and observe the old 
                abuses, which though not derived from use, are yet in use.  <!-- CG: The verb "delirant" has popped up before,
                and Harvey seems to use it to refer to the nonsense or ravings of scholastics. It's in the Domenichi, Ha2.019v:
                "Delirant famosissimi Scholastici." Perhaps this phrase could be modified to fit his tendency to denigrate older customs?-->
