                        Harvey dedicated his "Smithus" to to Meldway[?], but had a sub-dedication to John Wood, Smith's nephew + secretary
                        <!-- CG: I've no clue what that "Meldway" word is. I can't seem to find any indications anywhere in the book about Harvey dedicating it to anyone other than Wood.
                            Could it be two words? It looks like there's a space between the 'L' (E?) and the 'D.'-->

                        <!-- CG: I re-read "Studied for Action" and came across the name "Walter Mildmay," which I believe is the correct name here. -->
