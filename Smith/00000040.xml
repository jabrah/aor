                Audomarus Talaeus reports that Velia, the city in Lucania, had the name άπό τά έλεος, with the aspiration 
                turned in the Latin tongue into the vowel 'u'.
                Our grammaticians call 'u' a consonant.
                <!-- CG: The Greek (apo tou heleos) means something like "due to the marsh." 
                Apparently the original Greek name of Velia was Elea, which has to do with the terrain, I suppose. 
                Maybe we should also tag the location of 'Lucania.'  -->

                        Si iu, in Juno diphthongus esset, esset, ut uidetur, in Virgiliano carmine σιωαλλοιφή. nisi forte   <!-- CG: συναλλοιφὴ -->
                        διαίρεσιν esse putemus, et J&uuml;no sonandum arbitremur, quod nemo vnq[uam] obseruauit. Sed qui in his 
                        uocibus, aur&atiled;, aqu&atiled;, aul&atiled;i, pict&atiled;i, tam audacem, ut ita dicam, ferit <!-- CG: "aur&atiled;i" and "aqu&atiled;i" --> 
                        διαίρεσιν, potuit etiam eadem licentia J&uuml;no dicere.

            <translation>
                If the 'iu' in 'Iuno' were a diphthong, it would - as is clear - be σιωαλλοιφή in the Virgilian hymn. But we may   
                suppose it to be διαίρεσιν and judge that it is to be sounded 'Juno', something that no-one has previously 
                observed. But one who, if I may say, would be so bold as to make διαίρεσιν of these vowels - aur&atiled;, 
                aqu&atiled;, aul&atiled;i, pict&atiled;i - he could with the same wantonness say 'Juno'.
                <!-- JE: I suspect that my translation is missing something, due to my lack of Greek. -->
                <!-- CG: Both these Greek words are technical terms to describe the combination (synalepha) or separation (diaeresis) of vowels.
                    "If the 'iu' were a dipthong in Juno, it would undergo 'synalepha' in Virgil's poetry [meaning counted as one syllable].
                    But we may suppose is to undergo 'diaeresis' and judge that it is to be pronounced "J-uno," something that no-one
                    has previously observed. [The umlaut indicates diaeresis in poetry, meaning that the vowels of the diphthong are pronounced and
                    counted separately in the meter.] But one who would have the audacity to use diaeresis with this vowels, aura-i, aqua-i [...] 
                    could with the same wantonness say "J-uno.""-->
